# How Did This Get Started

My coworker gave me a RTL-SDR stick that he was no longer using. Like many free things, it became an expensive hobby.

## Current Setup

Lenovo Tiny 
FlightAware Blue Stick plugged into a powered USB hub
 - Was getting signal errors prior to using the USB hub, even thought the USB 3.0 slots should give 900 mAh
Fligth Aware 16 inch 1090MHZ antenna
 - Currently in garage, need to move to a pole behind shed, or into attic

## Uses

This is just something fun to see what I can do with the trackers.

Working on python ptograms to interact with data flow. First attempt turned hue lights blue and played a siren whenever a plan was with half a mile of the house. Most people didn't appreciate the air horn.




## Future Plans

Make the python program decent and send it out to others 

## Who I Feed
- Plane Finder
- Flight Aware
- ADSBExchange (will probably remove)
- ADSBx Replacements:
  - adsb.fi 
  - adsb.lol
  - adsb.one
  - theairtraffic.com
