# How Did This Get Started

I started this by finding a 100W Harbor Freight Solar pamel setup on craigslist. It came with four 25w panels, a PWM charger, and Thunderbolt 12v 35AH battery. 



## Current Setup

4 x 25w Harbor Freight Panels
Victron Smart Solar 100/20 MPPT Solar Controller
 - Raspbrry Pi 2 with VenusOS for remote monitoring via USB to VE.Direct connection
 - Powered by a 5v/3A buck convertter connected to the Fuse Block
Fuse Block with six circuits


## Uses

I mostly use the solar generated power to charge Ryobi batteries via the 12v car charger. A larger AGM battery is on deck to install when the weather is warmer. 


## Future Plans

Use a 300w Pure Sine Wave inverter to power some small 120v loads
Hook up some 12v LED light strips on the exterior of the shed.
