I try to keep focused on one project at a time, but usually keep it to twenty. 

Ongoing home rennovations. Always something to fix up. 

The kids get me into all kinds of projects. The most fun are powerwheels cars. We have a few for inside and a few for outside. I think I have more fun messing with the cars than the kids have riding them. 

The [shed has some solar power]({% link /shed-solar/ %}), but not much. I really just use it to power a pi that hosts Venus software to monitor the solar. Sometimes I will use it to charge powertool batteries. 

I have a lot of computer projects, but they revolve around two things - [ADS-B tracking]({% link /plane-tracking/ %}) and data storage. I also like to tinker with [mechanical keyboards]({% link /keeb-keychron-k8/ %}). 

Although not much of a gardener, we are trying to landscape in a useful way. The first step was creating a [christmas tree farm]({% link /planting-christmas-tree-seedlings/ %})in the front yard.
