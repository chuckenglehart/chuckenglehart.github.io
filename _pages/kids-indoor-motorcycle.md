# Story of This Motorcycle
This motorcycle was 'salvaged' from the trash. The neighbor throwing it away was king enough to give us the corresponding charger. He told me that the only issue was a bad ignition. 

I tried to force the ignition to turn, but it needed an actually keyed key. Pulled the ignition out and jumped the two sides to test to see if it worked. Worked fine, now the ignition just needed to be replaced. 

The hole for the ignition is 26mm. I bought a switch with a socket that was supposed to be 25mm, but didn't fit. A few mintues with a file and we are good to go. I crimped some 1/4 inch spade connectors to attach to the switch. The switch looks for slightly smaller connectors, but these stayed on there. 



## Kid's Review
This motorcycle comes with three speeds. It may as well have only had the highest one and saved the switch. 

Music is wonderful enough. They love stopping every 15 feet, playing a song and dancing, and then continuing on.
