Back in May 2013 I purchased this grill for $99 from Home Depot. It was on clearance since the red of the grill cover did not match the doors. Ten years of uncovered use later, it needed a few parts. Burners, crossover tubes, and flavorizer bars in particular.

The Brinkmann model is 810-1456-S, which does not have good aftermarket parts availabilty. I found that "Adviace Grill Replacement Parts for Brinkmann Pro Series 8300 BBQ" had the correct burners and crossover tubes. The flavorizers were just a little too long and wide. However for $29, the kit was worth it just for the burners and crossovers.

I started by pulling the grates and flavorizer tubes off, easy. Next was pulling off the burners and crossover tubes. The bolts holding them on were rusted and deteriorated. A dremel took care of that. A wire brush took most of the grease and soot off. Then a metal brush took most of the remaining grime off.

Putting it back together was similarly easy. The burners slid back over the 'needles', and the screw holes were offset so you know which way was supposed to be up. I used stainless steel 1/2 inch #10-32 bolts and nuts to attach the crossover tubes and burners to the gril frame.

The flavorizer tents are just sitting in place, but I don't expect them to be an issue.  Most of the tabs holding them in place are gone anyway.

Reset the regulator, connected propane, and the grill fired right up. The flames are unsuprisingly more even than with the rusted burners.
