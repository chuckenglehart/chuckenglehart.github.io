Part of our house rennovation was replacing the HVAC registers. I cam across these interesting floor registers, and ordered them for the few floor vents we have. They are Imperial Pop Up Floor Registers. I found them all over, but this was the best price:

They looked great on the floor and I wanted to add that functionality to my ceiling registers. They are designed to sit in the floor vent, and don't have an apparent way to attach to a ceiling register. There were some examples of people putting screws through the face, but I really like the clean look. 

After considering tape or magnets, I decided to just get some screws into the sides, and keep the flush look.

You want the screws to be on the front and back, not the short sides. If they are on the short sides they will interfere with the register closing. Another thing to avoid is lining the screws up with the supports of the vent face. They will interfere on the non-hinged side, ask me how I know...

The finished product looks pretty sleek, and I think it functions better than a typical register cover.
